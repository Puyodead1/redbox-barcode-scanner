# redbox-barcode-scanner

its a stupid simple app that scans data matrix barcodes, plays a tone for confirmation, pauses for a few seconds while adding it to a sqlite database. the database can be exported using the `export` button which opens a share sheet.

Barcodes can be matched to a product id and from there you can do what you want.
